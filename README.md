# 🐚 GreedySH - My Custom Shell in C  

Welcome to **GreedySH**, a simple shell written in **C** by **sanjib2006**! 🚀  
I am building this shell from scratch and implementing commands **one by one**.  

## ✅ Current Features  
- **`echo`** → Prints text to the terminal.  
- **`ls`** → Lists files in the current directory using `system("ls")`.  
- **`exit`** → Exits the shell.  
- **Unknown Command Handling** → Displays an error if the command is not found.  

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run  
```sh
gcc -o greedysh greedysh.c
./greedysh
```

## 🛠️ Upcoming Features  
- Support for more commands (e.g., `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`).  
- Piping (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `<`).  
- Background process handling (`&`).  

Stay tuned! 🚀
